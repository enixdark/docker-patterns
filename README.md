# Docker Patterns

This contains the slides for the presentation "Docker Patterns" which is based on [rhuss/docker-reveal](https://github.com/rhuss/docker-reveal) image.

It includes a HTML5 Terminal emulation which can be used from within the browser (look for slides named "Demo"). The demo can be find below `/demo` where each directory contains its own README.

For the demos to work, the following software is installed:

* Java 1.7
* Maven 3.3.9
* Docker 1.9.1
* Emacs 25.0.50.1

The image is best started with the include `run.sh` or for some more fanciness, there is also the [shell script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhuss/docker-patterns/master/startup-full.sh) which can be used with `$(curl -sL http://bit.ly/rhuss-docker-patterns | sh)`

With this startup script the presentation is then available at `http://docker_host:9000` where `docker_host` is the address of your Docker daemon's host (e.g. `localhost` or the IP of your boot2docker VM).

When watching the presentation you can use `m` for getting a Menu for directly navigating to individual slides. There you will also find section **Links** which useful links to additional information.

Have fun (and feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/rhuss/docker-patterns/issues) in case of questions or suggestions).
